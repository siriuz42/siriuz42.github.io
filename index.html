<h1 id="Yichen">Hello World! This is Yichen Zhou.</h1>

<p> Hi everybody! I am a second year Statistics Ph.D. student at <a href="http://stat.cornell.edu">Cornell University</a>. I am still on the run of finishing my required curriculum, which basically means homework dues. My fresh research focus is upon assessing the performance of classic statistical and machine learning methods. Recently I am digging around the intersection of random forests and decision trees.</p>

<p> I earned my B.S. in Pure and Applied Mathematics from Tsinghua University in Beijing. The coursework covered a wide range of the very fundamentions of advanced mathematics and my personal favorite was analysis.</p>

<p> I am also (sort of) an active coder in statistical related tasks. My coding works range from the cooperation with biologists to study protein struture, to a recent project with an preeminant artist in creating comtemporary paintings. </p>

<p> Fore more detialed information, please feel free to check the other columns of the site.</p>
