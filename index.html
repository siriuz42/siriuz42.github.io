<h1 id="Yichen">Hello World!</h1>

<p> I am Yichen Zhou, a second year Statistics Ph.D. student at <a href="http://stat.cornell.edu">Cornell University</a>. The life of a "second year" in a math related subject is still about finishing the required coursework, which is fun and most of the time "homeworky". </p>

<p>My fresh research focus is on assessing the performance of classic statistical and machine learning methods. Recently I am digging at the intersection of random forests and decision trees. I am also interested in high dimensional and Bayesian models and methods.</p>

<p> I earned my B.S. in Pure and Applied Mathematics from <a href="http://math.tsinghua.edu.cn">Tsinghua University</a> in Beijing. The coursework covered a wide range of the very fundamentions of advanced mathematics. My personal favorite was analysis.</p>

<p> I am also (sort of) an active coder in statistical related tasks. Stereotypical works consist of the cooperation with biologists to study protein struture, as well as a recent project with a preeminant artist in creating comtemporary paintings. </p>
