<h1 id="Yichen">Hello World! This is Yichen Zhou.</h1>

<p> Hi everybody! I am a second year Statistics Ph.D. student at <a href="http://stat.cornell.edu">Cornell University</a>. I am still finishing my required curriculum to enrich my archive of statistics, with a fresh focus on assessing the performance of classic statistical and machine learning methods. Recently I am digging around the intersection of random forests and decision trees.</p>

<p> I earned my B.S. in Pure and Applied Mathematics from Tsinghua University in Beijing. The coursework covered a wide range of the very fundamentions of advanced mathematics and my personal favorite was analysis.</p>

<p> I am also (sort of) an active coder in statistical related tasks. My coding works range from the cooperation with biologists to study protein struture, to a recent project with an preeminant artist in creating comtemporary paintings. </p>

<p> Fore more detialed information, please feel free to check the other columns of the site.</p>
