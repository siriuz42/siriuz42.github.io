Title: Thai Green Curry Wings
Category: recipe

Thanks to Ben Athiwaratkun for the recipe. 

Last weekend we have had our very inspiring end-of-semester party at Ben's apartment. He cooked this Thai flavored chicken wings which were definitely an explosion on our tongues. Here is the recipe that I have stolen from his omniscient cookbook. 

- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour  
- 1 teaspoon salt  
- 2 pounds chicken wingettes and drumettes (we also tried drumsticks)  
- 2.5 tablespoons red hot sauce  
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  

Here is the recipe.

1. Preheat the oven to 500&deg;F (260&deg;C). Line a large baking sheet with foil and spray with vegetable oil in a large bowl, mix the flour with the salt. Add the wings and toss to coat. Spead the wings on the prepared baking sheet in single layer and spray with vegetable oil. Roast the wings for about 45 minutes. Turning once or twice until browned and crispy.  
2. In a bowl, toss the wings with the sauce and butter.

For that exotic Thai flavor, 

1. Add to the flour coat: 1 teaspoon ground coriander.  
2. Add to the sauce: 2.5 tablespoons green hot sauce (replacing the red one), 0.5 tablespoon fish sauce, 1 teaspoon Thai green curry paste and 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro.
